<p class="content-box">Front-end web development involves creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website, such as layout, design, and user experience. Benefits include improved user engagement and website functionality. Tools commonly used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular. Internships typically offer hands-on experience with these tools, with tasks assigned via email to be completed within the 6-week period for practical learning.</p>
